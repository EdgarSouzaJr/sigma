This is the LVPP sigma-profile database for COSMO-based models. It currently contains information for more than **1700 molecules** as well as [**COSMO-SAC parametrizations**](https://github.com/lvpp/sigma/tree/master/pars).

For the COSMO-SAC parametrizations, check the [pars](https://github.com/lvpp/sigma/tree/master/pars) folder.

Currently, in this repository we only provide the COSMO apparent surface charges computed either with
[GAMESS](http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/gamess/) or [MOPAC](http://openmopac.net/).

You will still need [JCOSMO](https://www.ufrgs.br/lvpp/download/jcosmo/) other software to actually compute activity coefficients or other properties with models like COSMO-RS or COSMO-SAC.

## Using
The *processed* database is made available in ZIP files, check the [releases](http://github.com/lvpp/sigma/releases).
Just download one of the release files, uncompress and look for the molecule you need.
[JCOSMO](https://www.ufrgs.br/lvpp/download/jcosmo/) can be used to view the 3D apparent surface charge densities.

Currently we have the following releases:
* HF+TZVP using GAMESS
* POA1 using MOPAC

## Extending the database

There are different methods to extend the database.

### Ask LVPP to add new molecules

Just create and [new issue](https://github.com/lvpp/sigma/issues)
and describe the molecules you need that are missing.
If possible also attach a **3D mol** file for each molecule you want added.
It can take a while until we process your request.

### Process your own molecules

If you can't wait for us to process your molecules (or if you don't want to)
you can can **process** your own molecules.

Just **clone** or [download](https://github.com/lvpp/sigma/archive/master.zip) this repository and then
please check either the [GAMESS](https://github.com/lvpp/sigma/tree/master/GAMESS)
or the [MOPAC](https://github.com/lvpp/sigma/tree/master/MOPAC) folders for instructions
on how to process your own molecules.

Our instructions are for Ubuntu Linux 16.04 or superior. They probably should also
work on other similar systems.
